"Oh, shocked from the strike of his powerful bow,
The slain game sought by Adaniss falls.
Long ago in the time of the Quiet Earth,
The hunt from the famed High Forest calls.

"The Duke of Everlund known for his boast 
Of the trophies held in his pride as dear. 
Intensely enraged at his rival hunter
Whose bounty by far surpassed his one year. 

"One morn tragedy befell the land
With the misconceived death of the Duke's prized hound.
Fallen at the base of a great elm tree 
A bow's shot death in its heart was found. 

"With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still,
Never missing a kill,
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

"The same eve Adaniss called on the Duke,
His solemn mistake he wished to repay.
But the noble's rage claimed ten pounds of flesh
And an archer's arm hit the ground that day.

"The evil lord demanded justice unjust
The most vile curse on his arm to be cast.
Vengeance he sought for the price he had paid
Rhyte vowed the hound's arrow not to be his last.

"In sorrow the town helped him forge an axe
Blessed to honor his most glorious day.
With the mark of Rhyte's arrow to guide its strike
And reputed to kill in the very same way.

"With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still,
Never missing a kill,
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

"Again called the forest with its precious game,
And a prize Adaniss with thrill did he seek. 
But none could be finer than the great clawed falcon 
Sought by all amidst the forest's Lost Peaks.

"Once more the rivalry of the Duke did stir,
For he thought of his skills with Rhyte's bow to be best.
And set his sights on the glorious bird 
To emerge as the holder of its sainted crest.

"The two climbed the peaks and searched days on end,
Each of their wills set as strong as the stone.
They found each other at a cliff by chance;
Both of their hatreds ran as deep as the bone.

"With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still,
Never missing a kill,
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

"The Duke drew the bow and pulled the string taut,
But first flew Adaniss's axe with its blow.
Cleaved, the lord stumbled to cliff's edge and off,
Defeated by Rhyte's last arrow...

Bala was a foul-tempered prince of a gully dwarf clan, which was enslaved by a cruel elven mage in Thesk. Though Bala managed to escape the more cowardly traits of his race, he was even more filthy and obnoxious than the average gully dwarf. Sickened of his enslavement, Bala crept into the mage's lair and cracked the elf's skull open. Although rumor has it that it was the dwarf's stench that overcame the mage, it was, in fact, his enchanted axe that dispelled the elf's magical defenses. It is obvious from the poor workmanship that Bala himself crafted the axe. The mystery lies in where its power originates. After a lengthy career of mage-slaying, Bala died, never having revealed his secret to those who were willing to risk a lice infestation by approaching him. Some say that the axe was powered by Bala's intense hatred of wizards. The axe gives the owner the ability to dispel magic once a day.

In some circles known as Narbucchad's Fickle Finger, this weapon represents the culmination of his reign. Driven by paranoia and mistrust, Narbucchad successively eliminated his guard in fear of attempts at assassination , and channeled all of his magic into a weapon after his own that could strike down any foe or number of would-be assailants at a time. Originally devised for such dire circumstances only, he quickly grew fond of its potential to cut all sorts of quarrels short and before long came to rely upon it wholly.

However, the staff required frequent recharging as its enchantments, albeit powerful, would quickly drain in frequent use and spring the orb of power from its socket, requiring careful reinsertion. Many stories circulated of those who had survived and escaped by whim of his Fickle Finger and thus known, it happened to fail him at rather a crucial moment before long.

Both the staff and his reign were eventually lost to the annals of history, the former in absence of his spells reduced to an elaborate bauble. How it ended up here is anyone's guess. Its charge seems to have lessened slightly after having replaced the jewel.

In some circles known as Narbucchad's Fickle Finger, this weapon represents the culmination of his reign. Driven by paranoia and mistrust, Narbucchad successively eliminated his guard in fear of attempts at assassination , and channeled all of his magic into a weapon after his own that could strike down any foe or number of would-be assailants at a time. Originally devised for such dire circumstances only, he quickly grew fond of its potential to cut all sorts of quarrels short and before long came to rely upon it wholly.

However, the staff required frequent recharging as its enchantments, albeit powerful, would quickly drain in frequent use and spring the orb of power from its socket, requiring careful reinsertion. Many stories circulated of those who had survived and escaped by whim of his Fickle Finger and thus known, it happened to fail him at rather a crucial moment before long. 

Both the staff and his reign were eventually lost to the annals of history, the former in absence of his spells reduced to an elaborate bauble. How it ended up here is anyone's guess, but the fact that it appears to be fully charged suggests a tale worthy of its own.
